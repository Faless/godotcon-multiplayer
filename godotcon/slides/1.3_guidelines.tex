\frame{\frametitle{Guidelines}

There is no one fit all solution.

It really depends on you game. (genre, mechanics, interactions).

There are a few general guidelines

\begin{itemize}
    \item Everything should happen on the server, clients are mere dummy displays.
    \item Clients should only send their inputs or commands (server must discard disallowed commands)
    \item Send as little data as possible as often as possible to keep latency at a minimum for RT games.
\end{itemize}
