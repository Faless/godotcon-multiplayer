\begin{frame}{Benet module}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed to use ENet at full power
    \item Does not use RPC (unless you want to)
    \item Allow for \texttt{broadcast} \texttt{send} (to specific client)
    \item Uses signals to notify of recv packets, clients connect/disconnect
    \item Allow for unreliable but ordered channels (you don't have to manage time)
    \item Allows multiple channels
\end{itemize}

\footnotesize{\textbf{Note}: will likely not be included in Godot, I'm looking to port it to the C API by \textbf{karroffel} and \textbf{bojidar-bg} when it's ready}
