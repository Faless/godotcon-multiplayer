\begin{itemize}
\item Have the client sends some \textbf{ping packet}, if a ping is \textbf{not received} by the server for \textbf{more than X seconds}, the client is considered \textbf{disconnected}
\item Send and additional \textbf{time} value with packets you want to be ordered.
    \textbf{Keep} the \textbf{last received} time, if you receive a \textbf{lower time}, \textbf{drop it}. (see wrap)
\item Have the two parties add sequence numbers to pacekets and \textbf{send acknowledgment} of received data. \textbf{Keep a queue} of last sent/received packets. Stop sending until you receive an ack for the lowest missing packet if the new packet has a sequence number higher than the lowsest plus the ack window size. Reorder received packets... \textbf{mess}!
\end{itemize}
